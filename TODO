	Overall:

			ASAP -> to test new subscription creation:
				[]Product
				[]Product Rate Plan
				[]Product Rate Plan Charge
				[]Product Rate Plan Charge Tier
		[]figure out why savon setup breaks with rake and setting the log
		[]test / make it easy to configure with prod
		[]move custom fields to a file
		[]make each field an attr accesor? / figure out non database ActiveModel backed models ( is it worth it bc zuora is doing the validation, i guess it makes sense to do it before sending and not wasting a soap call, but what if something in the WSDL changes, HOW OFTEN DOES THAT HAPPEN!? i think it makes sense to validate before sending )
		[]singleton?
		[]bulk methods, ie create / delete / update 50 objects at once
			[]bulk subscribe
			[]bulk amend
