TODO:
	session.rb:
		[]subscribe
		[]amend
		[]update, make it only send new values, i.e ones that were set, not the ones that were queried
	Overall:
		[]more models	
		[]finish tests
		[]figure out why savon setup breaks with rake and setting the log
		[]test / make it easy to configure with prod
		[]move custom fields to a file
		[]make each field an attr accesor? / figure out non database ActiveModel backed models ( is it worth it bc zuora is doing the validation, i guess it makes sense to do it before sending and not wasting a soap call, but what if something in the WSDL changes, HOW OFTEN DOES THAT HAPPEN!? i think it makes sense to validate before sending )
